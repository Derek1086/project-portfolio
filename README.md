# Derek Avila's Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built with Vite and React to showcase my skills and projects. It provides an easy-to-use interface for users to explore my work on a responsive website that adjusts to fit any device. The website uses Taildwind and Shadcn for the CSS components.
